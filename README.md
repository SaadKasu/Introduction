Hello Everyone :)

My name is Saad Kasu, I am a java and apex developer.

I have been working as a software developer since 2021. Currently I am working at Apisero Inc.

I have started commiting my work done over the past few months one by one. It's mostly practice for machine coding rounds. All of these repos you see i.e. Tello, ParkingLot, Zoomcar, TicTacToe, SnakeAndLadder was done in around 3-5 hours.

I have written a lot of code but all of it is distributed on different websites and in different files.

I will try to push as much as possible and will make it a habbit to add new code henceforth.

I am planning to develop a Kafka clone in backend. I will push that code day by day.
